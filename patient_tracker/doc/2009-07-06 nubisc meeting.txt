# Background

Phase II - billing
* carrot - centralized billing
* patient payments, gift card tracking

Phase I carrots
* eirb will take this accrual information for their periodic review
* accrual data reports for sponsors
* crm, recruitment

# Demo

Feature: events - sort by study

Question: What level of participation require? Initially enrollment/completion (due to federal requirement)

Feature: template for upload, vocabulary for events

Question: how often will imports be used? for some coordinators, all the time. an issue of access and workflow. most efficient is paper consent/packets, then upload of stack in office. Works with existing workflow of coordinators. Should receive/feed data

Feature: Summary statement back (1000 put in correctly) - add a column with study name (eirb number), multiple studies at once

Typo: This is "a" => "the" registration system available at Northwestern

Question: why not collect ethnicity? Abel: as long as it's standardized. Necessary for NIH reporting (race and ethnicity) Warren: this is not an audit-able system, MR is audit-able, but that's not always correct. Cooperative group that audits us, wants to get the documentation behind source system (self-reported by subject at time of enrollment). Abel will share Hospital/HR system document with us. Must be a participant reported (NIH says if participant refuses, observer must report). Need source (subject/coordinator). Unknown/other/multiple is valid, refused is not. Andrew will send us details.

Question: Will enotis know who queried who's race? No, eNOTIS on application level. eNOTIS will keep logs. Use last one, history is an EDW question. Race should be on a patient level or involvement level? Attach it to subject, when it varies, attach it to study.

Feature: CSV file - must require race/ethnicity

Question: Can you refuse birthday? Original NOTIS requires it.

Feature: Can we accept excel files? EDW does ETL, parsing.

IRB is excited that this may drive compliance
Subjects and studies are supersets

Feature: NIH report carrot: accrual charts - allow them to add another column to enable grouping, refusals

We need as many carrots as possible, especially encouraging standardization and compliance
Eventually "clinical research" => "human subjects"

Question: Liebovitz: recruitment goals, provide details of how studies are doing? Rex: IRB/OPRS will want to see, Dean's office will want to see, don't want recruiter X, on study Y to see study Z. Warren: You can get that info on clinicaltrials.gov anyway in Jan '10.

Question: What about Children's? They are not on eIRB, have their own IRB. Adds a level of complexity. Children's is now in process to get data in EDW. Took about a year to get CMH approval for NOTIS. From a cancer trial standpoint, NOTIS will be in place, and NOTIS data will flow into eNOTIS. Half of trails at NU are in NOTIS (cancer center).

Feature: make sure to add gender

# PROMIS

Patient reported outcomes management information system
NIH roadmap, 5 years, 7 sites
A series of standardized PRO measures (fatigue, function, sleep), long/short/computer adaptive forms
FDA requires improvement
Government has sponsored 70 unique fatigue measures
Effort to standardize
Can scale against each other
Delivered early, very successful

Parallel project (neuroqual) in neurological domains/studies

Assessment center - computer adaptive software
Can add your own data, demographics
NIH is giving this away for free as a facility

PROMIS II is funded Oct 1, maybe another 4 years, growth will continue

Goal was for clinical trials. Cleveland Clinic in use, take as you register => Epic, take every time you visit
Patient enters, fill out surveys, charge nurse checks, doctor can see report (suicidality immediate alert), web based, stand alone, integrated voice response. High physician satisfaction (decreases physician time). Critical to push to medical record.

NIH toolbox
standardized assessments of cognitive functioning/motor health etc (same delivery system)
all free, going into validation

if funding runs out - 5 grand a year per study
produce same as SF12, SF36, for free and shorter
