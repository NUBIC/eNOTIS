Clinical Subject Registration made eASY

Hi, and welcome to eNOTIS, the enterprise []. My name is [], and I'll be walking you through eNOTIS.

# Basic Concepts

eNOTIS is a system that helps you keep track of *subjects* on *studies*. You can see the eIRB status of a study, and have access to consent forms or other documents from eIRB. You can add subjects to studies, and keep track of them from consent to ?completion?. 

Now what do we mean by *subject* and *study*? A human subject is any person ?that you've consented to be on a research study?. A study is any research at Northwestern that is tracked by the IRB. This includes ?clinical research that isn't a phased clinical trial, as well as observational or quality of life research.?

Events are anything that happens to your study or subject, such as approval or review of studies, consent or randomization of subjects.

Studies, Subjects and Events.

# Logging in

Before you can get started with eNOTIS you'll need a Northwestern NetID and password, and be authorized on at least one study in eIRB.

A Northwestern University NetID is an electronic identity. You may obtain a NetID through NUIT (Northwestern University Information Technology) at www.it.northwestern.edu/netid

The Northwestern University IRB provides oversight on research to protect and maximize benefit for human subjects. eIRB is the electronic system the IRB uses to manage research proposals. Since eNOTIS contains private subject data, training and approval by the IRB is needed, a process which may require a revision to be submitted to for the study.

Visit enotis.northwestern.edu and enter your netid and password
Click login, and you should see... oops, it looks like there was a problem with my netid and password. If you get stuck here, just visit this link to test your netid and password, and reset it if you need to.

Hmm, it looks like I can't log into eNOTIS because I'm not on a study in eIRB. I know I was just added a few minutes ago, but eNOTIS syncs with eIRB every few hours, so I may have to come back to this. Time for lunch!

Ok, I'm back now, and I'll enter my netid and password, and here we go. I'm in. This is my dashboard, where I can see the studies I'm approved on in eIRB, what events have happened recently.

Studies, Subjects, and Events. That's what eNOTIS is all about.
