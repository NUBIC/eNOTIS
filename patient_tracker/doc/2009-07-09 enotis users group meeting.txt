A coordinator should be able to see highlighted accrual status when they get close to their goals
A coordinator should be able to see highlighted study status when they get close to their periodic review
A coordinator should be able to see the next periodic review or expiration date
A coordinator should be able to see flagged subjects that were accrued when the study was suspended
A coordinator should be able to export a report with flagged subjects - missing mrns or accrued when study was suspended

# Design decisions
Require gender, race, ethnicity, date of birth (allow refused. allow other for race/ethnicity)
Allow multiple fields for race/ethnicity, deal with counting in reports, with statisticians
Minors are identified by their age at the time of the consent
Input format: mrn | fn | ln | dob | gender | ethnicity | race(s) | consented | enrolled | ...
You may always accrue people to studies - we'll flag them if we know accrual has happened when study is down
Study controller should use irb_number (not id) in url
For now, disable showing other studies that a subject is on until we can figure out who they are on

# Todos, Issues
Reggie: talk to eIRB to find out format of eIRB accrual report
Warren: what about accrual/goals on non-government funded studies? what about secret studies?
Jennifer: even with MRNs, Jennifer cannot tell us which of the subjects are on NUGENE. only numbers
Brenda: there is no way to identify studies (in eirb) that are secret

# Feature: import - multiple studies

Q: MRN - Hospital or NMFF, or fn/ln/dob
Q: Event types?
Q: eIRB - biz admins get access to a whole bunch of studies? push to eIRB

# Require
gender, race, ethnicity, dob
required fields allow other, refused
allow multiple fields for race/ethnicity?
how would you count (biracial subject counted as both)? deal with in reports, with statistician

# Identifying subjects
Identifying minors - on consent before 18th birthday
Other populations - prisoners? taken care of IRB approval

# How would you like to download data?
NIH style accrual report
One report of subjects on a study: completed, on study, screen fail
subject event? dead/alive

# MRNs useful for
linking subject to NMH and NMFF data - death, hospitalizations, other events
National death index => edw => enotis

# Carrots - value added
report to IRB the accruals: gender/race breakdowns - make sure it matches
our carrot: for periodic reviews, no paper submission required

# Adding subject
Heart failure - two dozen studies
Best way to find out if a subject on another study - ask subject, ask other coordinators
Identified 5 interesting subjects - mrns - see studies? accrual status? how much longer?
List of studies, current status in each study, current coordinator/contact info *Carrot

# Feature - audit log
need audit log of who has asked for whom

# Feature - flagging missing data

# Features - show accrual goal (flag when it gets close)
your project will expire in... (flag when it gets close)
next periodic review...
make clearer what is coming from eirb (e.g. staff list - from eirb)
graph

# When can you accrue subjects?
In the past, when the study was open
Periodic review status determines when you can/cannot accrue
when suspended - allow you to enter day - flag
when we generate report - show flags

# all studies
type, phase, accrual, and accrual goal
