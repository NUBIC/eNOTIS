2009-07-15 enotis team meeting

Brian: working on race/gender/ethnicity. There is no source of truth. Allow "refused", "other", "not collected"
David: finished manual sync process, adding events. Will work on import for race/gender
Mark: study by irb_number, auditing views

reviewed features from last user group meeting

What is status of EDW report? can we create a report for testing?

Show race/gender/ethnicity/address? Only for syncing flagged subjects.

Instead, change UI to mirror import process, one input, one result.
