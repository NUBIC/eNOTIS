subject
========
(un)matched to the edw
synced to medical record - locking/syncing
details locked for editing

(flag: leave me alone about this person?)

involvement
===========
subj (not) locked to mr
study (not yet) open/synced on eirb
x calculate status on the fly

involvement_events
==================

study
=====
(un)available to accrue subjects

possible scenarios
1. EDW down
2. record not inserted in EDW yet (nightly work)
3. local user only - pt will never be in EDW (no medical record) 

so a User creates local data
1-2 resolve themselves - clobber any local data (address/phone/email) - subjects table gets versioned
3 never resolved

System's purpose is primary source of truth is EDW so:
take data entered by user, dump it to a data field (notes?)
mashup into string, append to notes
arbitrary key/value store postponed to phase x

Reconciled?

Can it be calculated
