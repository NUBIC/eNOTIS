== Welcome to eNOTIS ==

eNOTIS is a research tool provided by NUCATS to aid researchers in managing patients on clinical trials. Developed in response to requests from the NU clinical research community, eNOTIS will be the primary clinical trial management system for all research at Northwestern University, utilizing the latest in web technology and security measures. Subject safety is at the core of the system: eNOTIS is both HIPAA compliant and recognized by the Northwestern IRB as an approved clinical research system. eNOTIS speeds up clinical trial set-up time by providing access to information about clinical studies through eIRB and to patient medical records through the NU Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW). This approach means less data entry and will reduce or eliminate the need for manual study tracking adoption.

== Installation ==

eNOTIS requires a few commands to get the data to start up:

    rake users:create_admins # creates admin users
    rake redis #imports data from redis store
    
== Dependencies ==

eNOTIS depends on a few important gems:

* bundler, currently the 0.9 branch
* pg, which may require archflags for OSX when you bundle: > env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem bundle
* and credentials files:
  - /etc/nubc/bcsec-[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/bcsec-staging.yml (not needed in development)

  - /etc/nubc/edw-[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/edw-staging.yml, which should contain the following keys:
  
    username:
    password:
    service_timeout:
    url:
    test_mrn:
  
  - /etc/nubc/eirb-[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/eirb-staging.yml, which should contain the following keys:

    url:
    username: 
    password:

  - /etc/nubc/db/p[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/pstage.yml (not needed in development or test)

  - /etc/nubc/couch-[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/couch-development.yml, which should contain the following keys:

    url: "http://localhost"
    port: 5984
    db: "eirb_prod"
