== Welcome to eNOTIS

eNOTIS requires a few commands to get the data to start up:

script/console
  Study.update_all_from_cache
  Study.update_coordinators_from_cache
  
rake users:create_admins
rake dictionary_terms:import

eNOTIS depends on a few important gems:

bundler, currently the 0.8 branch
pg, which may require archflags for OSX when you bundle:
  
  > env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem bundle

and credentials files:

/etc/nubc/bcsec-[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/bcsec-staging.yml (not needed in development)

/etc/nubc/edw-[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/edw-staging.yml, which should contain the following keys:
  
  username:
  password:
  service_timeout:
  url:
  test_mrn:
  
/etc/nubc/eirb-[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/eirb-staging.yml, which should contain the following keys:

  url:
  username: 
  password:

/etc/nubc/db/p[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/pstage.yml (not needed in development or test)

/etc/nubc/couch-[environment].yml, e.g. /etc/nubc/couch-development.yml, which should contain the following keys:
