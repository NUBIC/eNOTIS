          <p>Re: Policy requiring use of eNOTIS to track accruals using eNOTIS effective November 1, 2010</p>
          
          <p>To all clinical research investigators,</p>
          
          <p>Having an accurate, current count of interventional clinical trial accrual is critical for regulatory, reporting, and institutional needs. eNOTIS has been developed at Northwestern University to track this information, to deliver better visibility and to streamline clinical trials management. As a centralized repository, eNOTIS will reduce or eliminate the need for manual study tracking and provide easy access to reporting, both of which are resource-intensive parts of clinical research.</p>
          
          <p>We recently held a town hall meeting to identify potential barriers to using eNOTIS. Based on the feedback from that town hall meeting and the recommendations from the clinical research re-engineering task force, interventional studies will be required to track accrual using eNOTIS as of November 1st, 2010. All periodic reviews (a.k.a. continuing reviews) starting in November will be required to use eNOTIS to report accrual. In order for accrual numbers to be correct for your next continuing review, you will need to import all enrollment information, including historical subjects who may have already completed their portion of the study.</p>
          
          <p>For a working definition of interventional studies, we are using the definition in the FDA Amendment Act of 2007 (FDAAA):</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Interventional: studies in human beings in which individuals are assigned by an investigator based on a protocol to receive specific interventions. Subjects may receive diagnostic, therapeutic or other types of interventions. The assignment of the intervention may or may not be random. The individuals are then followed and biomedical and/or health outcomes are assessed.</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>This is in contrast to the other two classifications of studies that are defined by FDAAA:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li><p>Observational: studies in human beings in which biomedical and/or health outcomes are assessed in pre-defined groups of individuals. Subjects in the study may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other interventions, but the investigator does not assign specific interventions to the subjects of the study.</p></li>
          <li><p>Expanded Access: records describing the procedure for obtaining an experimental drug or device for patients who are not adequately treated by existing therapy, who do not meet the eligibility criteria for enrollment, or who are otherwise unable to participate in a controlled clinical study. Expanded Access records are used to register all types of non-protocol access to experimental treatments, including protocol exception, single-patient IND, treatment IND, compassionate use, emergency use, continued access and parallel track.</p></li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>Note that this is a subset of the studies that are required to be reported to clinicaltrials.gov, but will include multisite studies and industry sponsored studies. See <a href="http://www.research.northwestern.edu/ori/hottopic/index07.html">http://www.research.northwestern.edu/ori/hottopic/index07.html</a> for information on registering studies in clinicaltrials.gov.</p>
