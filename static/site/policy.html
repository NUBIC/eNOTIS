          <h3>To all Department Chairs, Administrators, Principal Investigators, and Research Staff:</h3>
          
          <p>Participants in clinical research studies are one of the most important components of our research enterprise. One of our foremost obligations to them is to make our best efforts to protect them from harm, whether physical, emotional or financial. A key element of this protection is to better identify them during clinical encounters where appropriate knowledge of their participation might be required to allow the best clinical care and to incorporate this information into our financial systems to assure they or their insurance providers are not inappropriately billed for services that are part of the research study. It is clear that we can and must improve our current practices.</p>
          
          <p>A wide range of faculty, research staff and administrative staff from Northwestern University (NU), Feinberg School of Medicine (FSM), Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH), and Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation (NMFF) have been working together to develop processes for improving our ability to identify participants in clinical trials and other clinical studies to assure proper billing. Based on this input the eNOTIS tool will be used as the central repository for all individuals enrolled in clinical trials or clinical studies. The goal of this system is to allow NMH and NMFF to identify patients participating in clinical studies in their clinical and financial systems. In order for NMH and NMFF to have an accurate list of clinical research subjects - all research participants in active clinical studies using NMH and/or NMFF medical services must be entered into eNOTIS by 8/31/11. Medical services include all research related billable tests or procedures use d for research eligibility screening and diagnosing or treating disease. Research personnel will be required to enter a medical record number or a limited amount of demographic data into eNOTIS for all research subjects. In addition, a new standardized Study Participant Research Voucher (SPRV) will be instituted and required for all patients receiving medical services. After 8/31/11, registration of study participants in eNOTIS and submission of a completed SPRV must be completed by the close (5:00 pm) of the next business day following study enrollment and/or consent.</p>
          
          <p>To facilitate and expedite this initiative, on-site trained temporary staff employed by NUBIC will work to enter all research subjects in active protocols using medical services into eNOTIS as well as to facilitate the adoption and implementation of the new SPRV. In addition, all research faculty and staff will be able to contact support staff who can answer questions at the following:</p>
          
          <p>eNOTIS Support: eNOTISsupport@northwestern.edu or (312) 857-3141</p>
          
          <p>SPRV Support: SPRVsupport@northwestern.edu or (708) 274-7778</p>
          
          <p><strong>After the initial adoption period has ended (8/31/11), study staff must enter into eNOTIS all research participants in active clinical trials that are using medical services and a SPRV must be submitted to NMH and NMFF after the provision of medical services by close of business the next business day.</strong></p>
          
          <p>Thank you for your thorough and expeditious attention to this important matter.</p>
