We need exception notifier installed on the app so if there is an error thrown we devrs get emails

We need to have a monit like process to monitor the whole app and the queue and the worker... to make sure they are at least alive... they wont send us exception emails if they are dead

And finally, it would be nice to be notified if the system cannot connect to the eirb and edw
and on average... the response time...
It could be a simple script that just hits the webservicies with a static query and gathers some stats and emails us if the ws can't be reached...

This is somewhat less important than the first two... but setting the first two up should be really easy
