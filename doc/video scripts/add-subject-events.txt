Clinical Subject Registration made eASY (Northwestern Oncology Trial Information System)

Hi, and welcome to eNOTIS, a secure, web-based system for Northwestern clinical researchers to track and report accrual information. My name is [], and I'll be walking you through eNOTIS.

# Adding a subject event

Just as a reminder, eNOTIS mainly deals with studies, subjects, and events. I spoke on the phone with a subject on one of my studies today, so I'm going to add a "contact" event.

Once I log in with my netid and password, I'm at the dashboard, where I can see a list of my studies and recent events. I contacted a subject on the [] study, so let's click on it. The study overview shows what has happened recently on my study, and who has access. I'm in adding a subject event, so I'll click on the "Study Subjects" tab, and click "add event" next to their name.

I'll pick the event, enter the date, and that's it. I've added an event to my subject.

So we're all set. My subjects are now associated with my study via the "Consented" event. Subjects, Studies, and Events.
