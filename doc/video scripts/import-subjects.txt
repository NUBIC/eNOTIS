Clinical Subject Registration made eASY (Northwestern Oncology Trial Information System)

Hi, and welcome to eNOTIS, a secure, web-based system for Northwestern clinical researchers to track and report accrual information. My name is [], and I'll be walking you through eNOTIS.

# Importing subjects

Just as a reminder, eNOTIS mainly deals with studies, subjects, and events. I consented a subject on one of my studies today, so we're going to add that subject with a "consented" event.

Once I log in with my netid and password, I'm at the dashboard, where I can see a list of my studies and recent events. I've consented a lot of subjects on the [] study, so let's click on it. The study overview shows what has happened recently on my study, and who has access. I'm importing subject, so I'll click on the "Subject Imports" tab.

Now, I'm going to download this excel template, and fill it in with my subjects.

Now, so that eNOTIS can identify each subject, I have to enter either an MRN or fn/ln/dob
every subject needs to have a race, ethnicity, and 

Time for lunch!


So we're all set. My subjects are now associated with my study via the "Consented" event. Subjects, Studies, and Events.
