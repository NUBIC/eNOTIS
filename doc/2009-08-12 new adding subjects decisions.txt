Issue: when you upload the same file with fn/ln/dob (no mrns) twice, as our app currently stands, it will create duplicates.

Solution for uploads:

* subject: when you create by fn/ln/dob, find or create scoped by study
* involvement: race is additive
* involvement: gender and ethnicity are not overwritten
* involvement events: are unique by type/date, are not overwritten. changed events are added as new events

These decisions follow a general guideline: uploads are for adding, the UI is for adding/deleting/editing
