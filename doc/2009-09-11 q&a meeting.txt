* eirb study status needs to be mapped - get help from peggy, audra, debbie
* matching Children's MRN, primary is MRN, subjects with multiple numbers - will be resolved when children's is put in edw - not for another year
* webcamp data entry is straightforward, reporting is very difficult
* involvement event => activity (event has connotations of adverse event)
* categorization, interventiona/q.o.l. industry/drug/phase/multi-site - if categorized wrong in eirb, hard to fix
* bigger issue - if things are wrong in eirb or edw, we should facilitate pushing the changes back to the source system
* see what studies you are authorized on, check off by date (kelly) - checking the eirb
* sort order on data dictionary terms (brian)
* report data error system (brian)
* validations - dates in reasonable ranges
* gender - need other
* need to identify edw reporter person
* do we have department through eirb? pi/sponsor acct #?
* we may need tagging in the future
* show accrual goal, expiration date, next review, approval date - get from eirb or manually enter
* report on studies that don't accrue
* eirb list - "site users" - pull a few studies and check with kelly. there are also pi/submission preparer/contact lists
