  Dear Clinical Research Investigator
%p
  Having an accurate account of all studies using clinical services and information about those services is critical for the university as well as our clinical partners. To identify those studies and build up the necessary data to notify our clinical partners of research-related services in a timely and compliant manner, we ask that you please complete the accompanying survey for each of your current studies. To reduce the burden on any one individual and streamline the process of answering the survey, you may delegate some or all of this activity by sharing the URLs for a study with your study personnel and/or financial staff. Taking the survey will require a valid Northwestern netid, and the survey can be saved at any point and reviewed or continued by anyone using the URL. The identity of each individual viewing and answering the survey will be tracked, but please do safeguard the URL. No patient identifiers are requested as part of the survey.
%p
  Please note that the link to the study-specific survey is NOT the URL of this page. A specific survey looks like:
  <a href="#">https://enotis.northwestern.edu/services/STU00XXXXXX/edit</a>
  where STU00XXXXXX is the IRB study number for the study. You will be able to copy and share the link to the survey page once you 
  have answered the following questions and submitted. 
  You will be able to copy the URL for each study survey from the link list below. 
  All of your staff and co-investigators with access to your study can use the 
  <a href="https://enotis.northwestern.edu/services/">https://enotis.northwestern.edu/services/</a> link to find the study as well.
