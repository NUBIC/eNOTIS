  Dear Clinical Research Investigators
%p
  Having an accurate account of all studies using clinical services and information about
  those services is critical for the university as well as our clinical partners. To identify
  those studies and build up the necessary data to notify our clinical partners of 
  research-related services in a timely and compliant manner, we ask that you please 
  complete the accompanying survey for each of your current studies. To reduce the
  burden on any one individual and streamline the process of answering the survey, 
  you may delegate some or all of this activity by sharing the URLs for a study 
  with your study personnel and/or financial staff. Taking the survey will require a
  valid Northwestern netid, and the survey can be saved at any point and reviewed or 
  continued by anyone using the URL. The identity of each individual viewing and 
  answering the survey will be tracked, but please do safeguard the URL. No patient
  identifiers are requested as part of the survey.

  For each of your studies listed below answer the question:
