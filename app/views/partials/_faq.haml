  %p.q When will we need to use eNOTIS?
  %p.a= "#{link_to 'Interventional', 'http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/definitions.html#StudyType'} studies approved after November 1, 2010 are required to enter accrual in eNOTIS (see #{link_to 'policy', '/policy.html'}). Current interventional studies will be required to enter all accrual data into eNOTIS for their next IRB review. This includes historical data on subjects who already completed their portion of the study. eNOTIS has the ability to import existing subject lists in #{link_to 'csv format', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values'}.".html_safe

  %p.q What data will we need to enter?
  %p.a If your study is greater than minimal risk or uses NMH or NMFF medical services, you must enter: first name, last name, date of birth, NIH race and ethnicity, gender, consent and completion dates. Study information will come from the eIRB and will not require double entry.
  
  %p.q When will eNOTIS reflect new and terminated personnel, as authorized personnel list revisions take time in eIRB?
  %p.a The IRB is committed to providing expedited review and implementation of faculty and staff changes for any IRB study. The University has immediate termination of access procedures in place, including netID cutoffs synchronized with physical notification in cases of employee termination.

  %p.q Who will be able to accrue and view the subjects accrued on a study?
  %p.a Only the IRB authorized PI, co-investigators and coordinators will be able to view the identity of subjects accrued on a study. Any additional roles and responsibilities should be clarified with the IRB and added to the authorized personnel list in eIRB.

  %p.q What information will eNOTIS show about subjects and other studies?
  %p.a Each subject is represented once in eNOTIS. Users who have accrued a subject will be able to view all other studies a subject is accrued on. 

  %p.q Is eNOTIS IRB approved? Will consent language need to be updated?
  %p.a= "eNOTIS is IRB approved, and all studies may begin using eNOTIS without first updating their current consent forms. #{link_to 'The language that covers the use of eNOTIS', "#", :rel => '#database-language'} is now part of #{link_to 'the IRB consent template', 'http://www.research.northwestern.edu/OPRS/irb/templates/#informed-consent'}, in the \"Database\" section. Please note that the consent form must be updated to include the language covering eNOTIS during the next consent form revision or continuing review. eNOTIS is a secure and centrally managed resource for data that is already being tracked by all groups engaged in clinical research.".html_safe
  %p.q What HIPAA or other security issues are raised by use of eNOTIS?
  %p.a All subject identity searches in eNOTIS are logged. All eNOTIS users have CITI training, as validated by the IRB. We do not anticipate any additional security or HIPAA-related issues.
