  To all clinical research investigators,
%p
  Having an accurate account of all studies using clinical services and information about those services is critical for the university as well as our clinical partners. To identify those studies and build up the necessary data to notify our clinical partners of research-related services in a timely and compliant manner, we ask that you please complete the linked web-based form for each of your current studies. To reduce the burden on any one individual and streamline the process of filling out the form, you may delegate some or all of this activity by sharing the URL for a study with your study personnel and/or financial staff  
%p
  Accessing the form requires a valid Northwestern NetID and you must be on campus (NU, NMH, NMFF, RIC, CMH) or be logged into a campus VPN. Access to the form also requires that each person have a role in eIRB. The form can be saved, reviewed or continued at any point. The identity of each individual viewing and answering the form will be tracked. No patient identifiers are requested. The form has the following items:
%ul
  %li How many participants are currently enrolled in this study? 
  %li In the future, how many participants do you think you will enroll before the completion of the study?
  %li In the future, how many participants do you think you will require clinical services as part of this study?
  %li Will you use medical services before completing this study?
  %li Does this study expect bedded outpatient services?
  %li Does this study expect inpatient services?
  %li How many inpatient days are covered by research?
  %li How many inpatient days are covered by standard of care?
  %li Does this study involve pharmacy?
  %li Does this study involve labs/pathology?
  %li Does this study involve imaging?
  
%p
  In a follow-up survey, you will be asked to itemize the services required as part of the screening protocol and the study, and indicate the site (NMFF, NMH, RIC, CMH, NUCATS CRU, elsewhere) where the service is to be performed.
%p
  The form is at:  
  %a{:href => "https://enotis.northwestern.edu/services"} https://enotis.northwestern.edu/services
  %br
  You will be asked to login with your NU netid.
%p
  Please note that the link to the study-specific form is not the URL above â€“ that is the link to see a list of all of your studies. A specific form looks like:
  %br
  https://enotis.northwestern.edu/services/STU00XXXXXX/edit
  %br
  where STU00XXXXXX is the IRB study number for the study. You will be able to copy the link from the list of studies on the https://enotis.northwestern.edu/services/ page. All of your staff and co-investigators with access to a study can use the https://enotis.northwestern.edu/services/ link to find the study as well.
%p
  Your prompt response to this email is very much appreciated.
  %strong All surveys completed by February 1st will be entered into a raffle for an iPad. All forms are due by February 4th.
